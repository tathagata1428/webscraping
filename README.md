This code is a Groovy script that utilizes the Jsoup library for web scraping and image downloading. It performs the following steps:

1. Imports the necessary classes from Jsoup, Java's file system, and URI handling.
2. Sets the `destinationDirectory` variable to the path of the user's home directory followed by '/Downloads'.
3. Creates the destination directory if it doesn't exist using the `Files.createDirectories()` method.
4. Prompts the user to enter the URL of the website they want to scrape.
5. Attempts to connect to the specified webpage using Jsoup's `connect()` method and retrieve its HTML content as a document.
6. Finds the first image element (`<img>`) in the document using the CSS selector `img`.
7. Extracts the source URL of the image from the image element using the `attr()` method.
8. Converts the relative URL of the image to an absolute URL by resolving it against the base URI of the document.
9. Downloads the image by making a connection to the absolute URL using Jsoup's `connect()` method, ignoring the content type.
10. Retrieves the image data as bytes using the `bodyAsBytes()` method of the Jsoup connection.
11. Extracts the filename from the absolute image URL by getting the substring after the last occurrence of the '/' character.
12. Removes any illegal characters from the filename using the `replaceAll()` method with a regular expression.
13. Constructs the destination path by combining the `destinationDirectory` and the filename using the `Paths.get()` method.
14. Writes the image data to the destination path using the `Files.write()` method.
15. Prints a success message along with the saved path if the image is downloaded successfully.
16. Catches any exceptions that occur during the process and prints an error message along with the exception message.

In summary, this script allows users to input a URL of a webpage, scrapes the first image found on that page, converts the image URL to an absolute URL, and downloads the image to the specified destination directory on the user's system.
